# Simon-Game

## Hello! ðŸ‘‹

Thank you for your interest in my project.

Is a game that is modeled off the game Simon. So the way that it works is that you can press any key to start and it will show you a tile that you have to click on.

And as you go from level to level, the patterns get more and more complicated, and at some point you're going to screw up, and it's going to tell you that you've got it wrong and game is over, so you can press any key to restart the game.

It's made with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery.

## Let's play!
